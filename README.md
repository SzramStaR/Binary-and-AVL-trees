# Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an AVL Tree in Python. It includes the following features:

- Insertion of nodes into the tree
- Deletion of nodes from the tree
- Searching for the minimum and maximum values in the tree
- Traversing the tree in different orders (in-order, pre-order, and post-order)
- Rebalancing the AVL tree using the DSW algorithm

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your Python development environment.

3. Run the `main.py` file to execute the program.

## Usage

The program provides a menu with various operations that can be performed on the binary search tree and AVL tree. Choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding number and follow the instructions provided.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need to understand and implement different types of binar
