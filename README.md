# Binary-treees
Binary and AVL trees written objectively in Python.
The code includes classes for Node, BST, and AVL trees. The Node class represents a single node in the tree, while the BST class implements the functionality for a basic binary search tree. The AVL class extends the BST class to create an AVL tree, which automatically balances itself to maintain optimal performance.

The implemented trees support operations such as inserting values, deleting values, finding the minimum and maximum values, performing tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), and rebalancing the tree.

By utilizing these tree structures, developers can efficiently store and manipulate data while maintaining the desired order and ensuring optimal performance.
